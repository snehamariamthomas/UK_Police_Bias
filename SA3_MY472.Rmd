## __INTRODUCTION__
&nbsp; 

##### The diverse ethnic landscape of the United Kingdom prompts a critical examination of interactions with local law enforcement. This study seeks to uncover any potential disparities in policing practices within this cosmopolitan society.
&nbsp;

##### This research endeavours to reveal biases,if any, within varied ethnic encounters with law enforcement by:    
##### - Correlating police deployment with non-white populations      
##### - Analysing ethnic diversity in police force and its impact on stops    
##### - Investigating biases in associating searched objects with suspect ethnicity   
##### - Assessing disparities in post-stop-and-search treatments       
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## __DATA__
&nbsp;

### __**About Datset**__:  

##### The study is centered on the 2021 stop-and-search police dataset, investigating interactions among various ethnicities during that year. Additionally, it leverages the concurrent release of the 2021 census data to enhance demographic insights without adjusting for population changes,as the study is confined to this single year's datasets.Other datasets used in the study are referenced where they contribute to the analysis.
&nbsp;

### __**Data Processing**__:  

##### 1. To align police stop-and-search data, gathered by territorial force areas, with census data collected at the local authorities' level, aggregation was needed to match local authorities with their corresponding territorial force areas.      

##### 2. The Census data, with 19 sub-ethnicities, was grouped into broader categories: Asian, Black, Mixed, White, and Other. While maps display sub-ethnicities in local authorities and police force areas, the primary analysis concentrates on major ethnic groups.    

##### 3. Similarly,police records categorised officers' ethnicities into major ethnicities, whereas suspects' sub-ethnicities were recorded. The latter were aggregated into major ethnicities for facilitating comparison and analysis.  

##### 4. Though the study glimpses into ethnic representation at police jurisdiction levels, it transitions from a focus on sub-areas to a national-level analysis. It aimed to overcome limitations posed by varied, small-scale sub-ethnicities across regions. Limited statistical significance and variation among these subsets impeded a detailed analysis, while diverse population sizes within regions added complexity to understanding these sub-ethnicities comprehensively.    

##### 5. The British Transport Police (focus on railway policing) was omitted from analysis to maintain a focus on police jurisdictions under local authorities' purview.   

##### 6. The stop-and-search dataset includes individuals who self-reported their ethnicity as "Unknown." These instances were excluded from the analysis to align with population-relative datasets, as census records lack estimates for such categories.  

##### 7. I utilised RSQLite to organise and store the extensive dataset (police stop-search data). Each analysis on this dataset was conducted using targeted SQL queries.   

##### 8. The confidence in local police dataset is derived from survey data, not reflective of the entire populace.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## __ANALYSIS__
&nbsp;

### __**1. Background**__
&nbsp;

##### 1.1. To gauge the cosmopolitanism of the UK population, these maps illustrate the global origins of residents in the country and their distribution relative to the total population across Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and England.

&nbsp;

##### A correlation of __0.99__ signals robust connection between larger non-ethnic populations and heightened officer deployment, suggesting that areas with larger non-ethnic populations might experience more police involvement.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

#### __2.2. Police Force Analysis__
&nbsp;

##### A diverse police force is crucial for building trust, community relations, and operational effectiveness. Reflecting community diversity fosters understanding, fair treatment, and effective crime resolution while reducing biases and improving communication for equitable policing.
&nbsp;

##### __2.2.1. Police Force Diversity__
&nbsp;

##### Officers typically stop suspects from their own ethnicity, but 'Mixed' officers notably stopped many from â€˜Otherâ€™ ethnicity too.It could stem from officers feeling comfortable interacting with similar ethnicities. It might improve interactions but raises concerns about biases and unequal dynamics during stop and search.

##### Higher arrest and warning counts among 'Other' and Black ethnicities post-search suggest greater police involvement, contrasting with fewer engagements for White individuals across all outcomes.This raises concerns of potential bias in post-stop decision-making, particularly for Black and 'Other' ethnicities facing disproportionately lower legal actions despite higher stop rates, hinting at disparities in law enforcement.

##### The dataset tracks confidence levels in local police among various ethnicities over years. While Asian and White communities held steady confidence , the Black community experienced a decline from 73% to 64% signalling dissatisfaction. The 'Other' group showed variability but generally decreased confidence.

##### Among major ethnic subgroups, the Chinese and 'Asian Other' have relatively higher confidence compared to other Asian ethnicities. The Black subgroup ,in general, have shown decreasing confidence with greatest variation in 'Black Other'. Similarly, White Irish demonstrate higher confidence compared to White British in White subgroup.
